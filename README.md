# TripPlanner

A journey-planning console application written in Java for the Advanced OOP Course.

### Documentation:

This application is used to manage and organize information needed when traveling.
It has the next operations implemented:

**Objectives** are places you plan on seeing on this trip, they can be anything from landmarks and restaurants to bars or abandoned buildings.

- add objective
- list objectives
- mark objective as seen 
- show details for objective

**Travel Methods** are another thing you have to keep in check when travelling.
There are two traveling methods which inherit a base class, those are short-distance means of travel, for intra-city moving, and long-distance ones,
for example taking an airplane to reach a different country.
- add travel method
- show travel methods
- remove travel method

**Reminders** are there so you don't forget anything you were supposed to do when traveling.
These can be associated with an objective (for example getting tickets online before visiting an art gallery),
or they can exist by themselves.
- add reminder
- show reminders
- mark reminder as done
- remove reminder
